# Bank-Customer-Churn

# Introduction:

This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive banking dataset to understand customer behavior and financial interactions within a banking context. The dataset includes crucial information such as credit scores, demographics (country and gender), age, tenure with the bank, account balance, number of products held, credit card status, active membership, estimated salary, and churn rate. By exploring this rich dataset, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help in predicting customer churn, improving customer retention strategies, and enhancing overall financial health analysis.

# Key Questions

* What is the distribution of customers across different countries in the dataset?
* Is there any discernible pattern or relationship between credit scores and countries in the dataset?
* What are the key summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for credit scores in the dataset?
* How does the churn rate differ between customers who hold credit cards and those who do not?
* How does the distribution of account balances vary across different countries?

# Data and Tools

For the analysis, the bank's relational database management system and PostgreSQL were utilized. The dataset contains details about the bankâ€™s customers, including credit scores, demographics, age, tenure, account balances, number of products held, credit card status, active membership, estimated salary, and churn rates. This comprehensive dataset allows for in-depth analysis of factors influencing customer retention and churn prediction.
